      "Using the result obtained in 1.3.6 , at some point in time $t$ we can write the following equations for the velocity of a point: $$ v_x = v \\cos\\alpha $$ $$ v_y = v \\sin\\alpha - gt $$ The equation for the displacement of a point along the axes will be: $$ x = vt \\cos\\alpha $$ $$ y = vt \\sin\\alpha - \\frac{gt^2}{2} $$ At any point $M$, the square of the distance $r^2$ from the origin to this point can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. We are looking for the square so as not to bother with extracting the square root, since we do not need the value of $r$ itself: $$ L_M = r_M^2 = x_M^2 + y_M^2 $$ $$ L_M = (vt \\cos\\alpha )^2 + \\left(vt \\sin\\alpha - \\frac{gt^2}{2}\\right)^2 $$ To determine the domain of decrease of the function $L(t)$, we need to find the values of $t$ for which the derivative $L'(t)$ will be negative. Let's simplify $L(t)$ by opening the brackets and using the basic trigonometric identity, and then find the derivative: $$ L(t) = t^2v^2 - vt^3g\\sin\\alpha + \\frac{1}{4}g^2t^4 $$ $$ \\frac{dL}{dt} = 2tv^2 - 3vt^2g\\sin\\alpha + g^2t^3 $$ $$ \\frac{dL}{dt} = t\\left(2v^2 - 3v\\tan\\sin\\alpha + g^2t^2\\right) $$ It remains to solve the inequality: $$ 2v^2 - 3v\\tan\\sin\\alpha + g^2t^2 < 0 $$ First, we determine the points where the left side becomes zero, and then we find the necessary intervals. We get a quadratic equation with respect to $t$; its solution is trivial and I will not give it. We get two roots, which can be written in one expression: $$ t \\in \\left[t_1;\\min\\left(t_2, \\frac{2v\\sin\\alpha}{g}\\right)\\right], $$ $$ t_1 = \\frac{v}{2g}\\left(3\\sin\\alpha - \\sqrt{1 - 9\\cos^2 \\alpha}\\right), $$ $$ t_2 = \\frac{v}{2g}\\left(3\\sin\\alpha + \\sqrt{1 - 9\\cos^2 \\alpha}\\right), $$ $$ \\alpha\\in [70.53^\\circ; 90^\\circ] $$ If you are interested in the duration of the time interval during which the approach occurs, it is equal to: $$ \\min\\left(t_2, \\frac{2v\\sin\\alpha}{g}\\right) - t_1 $$ If the minimum is $t_2$, we get the solution: $$ \\frac{v}{g} \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 9\\cos^2 \\alpha}, \\quad \\alpha\\in[70.53^\\circ; 90^\\circ] $$ $t=(V/g)\\sqrt{9\\sin^{2}\\alpha -8}$ with $\\sin\\alpha >\\sqrt{8/9};$ $ t=0$ with $\\sin\\alpha <\\sqrt{8/9}.$\n",

The coordinates of point $A$ are $ (kr, 0) $, where $ k = \\frac{R}{r} $. Let us consider how the coordinates of point $A$, tied to the rolling circle ($A$ goes to $ A' $), change. Let the small circle roll so that its center moves from point $ C' $ to point $ C'' $ and rotates relative to point $ O $ by angle $ t $. First, it can be shown that the rotation of the small circle relative to its center (i.e. the angle between $ CA $ and $ C' A' $) is equal to $ t - kt = -(k-1)t $. Second, the coordinates of point $ C' $ will be as follows: $ (cos(t)(k-1)r, \\sin(t)(k-1)r) $. Then, knowing where the center of the rolling circle will go and at what angle it has turned relative to this center, we can write down the coordinates of point $ A' $: $ \\begin{cases} x = \\cos(t)(k-1)r + \\cos((k-1)t)r \\\\ y = \\sin(t)(k-1)r - \\sin((k-1)t)r \\end{cases} $ The trajectory of the wheel rim point passes along the cylinder diameter.\n",

      "Problem diagram Let's consider the forces acting on the box (Fig.). These are the force of gravity $ m \\vec{g} $, the tension force of the rope $ \\vec{F} $, the reaction force of the collision $ \\vec{N} $ and the friction force $ \\vec{F}_{пт} $, the magnitude of which $ \\vec{F}_{пт} = \\mu N $. Let's project all the forces in the direction along the convergence and perpendicular to them and write down the corresponding equations of motion. Since the box does not move in the direction perpendicular to the convergence, the sum of the projections of the forces in this direction must be equal to zero, that is, \\[ N + F \\sin ( \\beta - \\alpha ) - mg \\cos\\alpha = 0, \\tag{1} \\] Along the convergence, the box moves with acceleration $ a $ (in the special case of uniform motion $ a = 0 $), therefore the sum of the projections of the forces must be equal to $ ma $: \\[ F \\cos( \\beta - \\alpha ) - mg \\sin\\alpha - \\mu N = ma. \\tag{2} \\] From equations (1) and (2) we obtain: \\[ F = \\frac{ma + mg ( \\sin\\alpha + \\mu\\cos\\alpha )}{ \\cos ( \\beta - \\alpha ) + \\mu\\sin ( \\beta - \\alpha ) }. \\tag{3} \\] Only the denominator of the angle $ \\beta$ is included in the obtained expression for the force $ F $. Consequently, the magnitude of the force $ F $ will be minimal at such a value of the angle $ \\beta$, at which the denominator in formula (3) is maximal, that is, the magnitude is maximal \\[ \\cos ( \\beta - \\alpha ) + \\mu\\sin ( \\beta - \\alpha ). \\] Let's make some transformations. Let's represent the coefficient of friction $ \\mu$ as the tangent of some angle $ \\gamma$: \\[ \\tan\\gamma = \\mu ; \\quad \\gamma = \\arctan \\mu ; \\] \\[ \\sin\\gamma = \\frac{ \\mu}{ \\sqrt{1 + \\mu^{2} } }; \\quad \\cos\\gamma = \\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{1 + \\mu^{2} } }. \\] Then we can write: \\[ \\cos ( \\beta - \\alpha ) + \\mu\\sin ( \\beta - \\alpha ) = \\sqrt{1 + \\mu^{2} } \\cos ( \\beta - \\alpha - \\gamma ). \\] The last expression is maximal and equals \\[ \\sqrt{1 + \\mu^{2}} \\quad \\text{at} \\quad \\beta - \\alpha - \\gamma = 0, \\quad \\text{that is, at} \\quad \\beta = \\alpha + \\gamma = \\alpha + \\arctan \\mu . \\tag{4} \\] At this value of the angle $ \\beta$, the force $ F $ is minimal. Moreover, if the box moves uniformly ($ a = 0 $), then \\[ F_{min} = \\frac{mg( \\sin\\alpha + \\mu\\cos\\alpha ) }{ \\sqrt{1 + \\mu^{2} } }. \\] and when moving with acceleration $ a $ \\[ F_{min} = \\frac{ma + mg ( \\sin\\alpha + \\mu\\cos\\alpha ) }{ \\sqrt{1 + \\mu^{2} } }. \\] However, this solution is not true for any acceleration. Since the direction of the force $ \\vec{F} $ does not depend on $a$, and the absolute value of the force $ \\vec{F} $ increases with increasing acceleration, then at some value of acceleration $ a = a_0 $ the force $ \\vec{F} $ will be such that its component $ F \\sin (\\beta - \\alpha ) $, perpendicular to the inclined plane, will be equal in absolute value to the component of the force of gravity $ mg \\cos\\alpha$. In this case, both the force $ \\vec{N} $ and the force $ \\vec{F}_{tr} $ will vanish. In the future (for $ a > a_0 $), in order for the box not to come off the runners, the direction of the force $ \\vec{F} $ must change with increasing acceleration so that the component of the force $ \\vec{F} $ perpendicular to the inclined plane remains equal to the component of the force of gravity, that is, \\[ F \\sin (\\beta - \\alpha ) = mg \\cos\\alpha\\] For the components of these forces parallel to the inclined plane, we can write \\[ F \\cos (\\beta - \\alpha ) - mg \\sin\\alpha = ma \\] From the last two equalities, we find \\[ \\tan (\\beta - \\alpha ) = \\frac{g \\cos\\alpha}{g \\sin\\alpha + a} \\] whence \\[ \\beta = \\alpha + \\arctan \\frac{g \\cos\\alpha}{g \\sin\\alpha + a} \\] The value of $ a_0 $ can be found from the fact that for $ a = a_0 $ the values ​​of the angle $ \\beta$ from (4) and (5) coincide: \\[ \\alpha + \\arctan \\frac{g \\cos\\alpha}{g \\sin\\alpha + a_0 } = \\alpha + \\arctan \\mu\\] whence \\[ a_0 = g \\left( \\frac{\\cos\\alpha}{\\mu} - \\sin\\alpha\\right) \\] Thus, for $ a \\leq a_0 $ (and therefore for uniform motion too) \\[ \\beta = \\alpha + \\arctan \\mu\\] For $ a > a_0 $ \\[ \\beta = \\alpha + \\arctan \\frac{g \\cos\\alpha}{g \\sin\\alpha + a} \\] We have solved the problem. However, we will give another solution. This is a beautiful geometric solution. For uniform motion along the slope, the sum of all forces must be zero. We will replace the forces $ \\vec{N} $ and $ \\vec{F}_{пт} $ with their resultant $ \\vec{Q} = \\vec{N} + \\vec{F}_{пт} $ (Fig.) and add the forces $ \\vec{Q}, \\vec{F} $ and $ m \\vec{g} $. They must form a closed triangle. Let us replace that the direction of the force $ \\vec{Q} $ makes an angle $ \\delta$ with the perpendicular to the inclined plane such that \\[ \\tan\\delta = \\frac{F_{тре}}{N} = \\frac{\\mu N}{N} = \\mu\\] Thus, when the magnitude and direction of the force $ \\vec{F} $ change, the direction of the force $ \\vec{Q} $ remains unchanged. Consequently, the absolute value of the force $ \\vec{F} $ will be minimal if it is perpendicular to the vector $ \\vec{Q} $ (Fig.). (since the magnitude and direction of the vector $ m \\vec{g} $ are constant), then the minimum force will be equal to: \\[ F_{\\min} = mg \\sin\\alpha + mg \\mu\\cos\\alpha = mg (\\sin\\alpha + \\mu\\cos\\alpha ) \\] Thus, the value of the minimum force required to lift the box with acceleration $ a \\leq a_0 $ is equal to \\[ F_{\\min} = mg (\\sin\\alpha + \\mu\\cos\\alpha ) \\] If the acceleration $ a > a_0 $, then for the minimum force $ \\vec{F} $ directed at an angle $ \\beta$ to the horizontal, we have: \\[ \\beta = \\alpha + \\arctan \\frac{g \\cos\\alpha}{g \\sin\\alpha + a} \\] $$ \\beta = \\alpha + \\arctan \\mu $$\n",

When determining the magnitude of the friction force, it is necessary to take into account that, in accordance with Newton's third law, the body acts on the board, and the board on the body, so a double friction force will be exerted $$ F_t = \\mu g (m_1 + m_2) $$ Condition for starting movement: $$ \\boxed{F > \\mu g (m_1 + m_2)} $$ To determine the sliding time, we use kinematic equations: $$ l = \\frac{a t^2}{2} \\Rightarrow t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{a}} $$ The acceleration a when a constant force $F_0$ acts along the board is determined from the equation of Newton's second law in projection onto the direction of motion: $$ F_0 - F_t = m_1 a $$ $$ a = \\frac{F_0 - \\mu g (m_1 + m_2)}{m_1} $$ Sliding time: $$ \\boxed{t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 L m_1}{F_0 - \\mu g (m_1 + m_2)}}} $$ $b)$ The body is acted upon by two external forces $F_0$ and the friction force $F_{tr}$.

      "Let's renumber the weights as shown in the figure, and direct the $X$ axis to the right. Forces acting on the weights It is clear that then none of the weights can have negative acceleration. Let's prove that weights $3$ and $4$ move as a single whole. To do this, let's assume the opposite: let weight $3$ slide on weight $4$. Then a friction force arises between them $$ F_{fr}= \\mu mg $$ and elastic force arises in the thread $$ T> \\mu mg $$ In this case, the acceleration of load $2$ would be directed to the left, which is impossible. Therefore, the accelerations of loads $2$, $3$, and $4$ are the same. Let us denote the acceleration of these loads as $\\bar{a}_{1}=\\bar{a}_{2}$, and the acceleration of load $1$ as $\\bar{a}_{1}$. Now consider two cases. Case 1. Let loads $1$ and $2$ be at relative rest and $\\bar{a}_{1}=\\bar{a}_{2}$. Let us denote the modulus of the static friction force between them as $F_1$, the modulus of the friction force between loads $3$ and $4$ as $F_2$, and the modulus of the elastic force of the thread as $T$ . Then: for cargo $1$ $$ F-F_{1}=Ma_{1} $$ for cargo $2$ $$ F_{1}-T=ma_{2} $$ for cargo $3$ $$ T-F_{2}=ma_{2} $$ for cargo $4$ $$ F_{2}=Ma_{2} $$ Solving this system of equations, we obtain: $$ F_{1}=\\frac{2m+M}{2(M+m)}F,a_{1}=a_{2}=\\frac{F}{2(M+m)} $$ The same result can be obtained in another way. Since the friction between all surfaces is static friction, the system of loads moves as one body with mass $M=2(M+m)$. Therefore $$ \\bar{F}=m \\bar{a}_{1},\\bar{a}_{1}=\\bar{a}_{2}= \\frac{\\bar{F}}{2(M+m)} $$ Case $2$. Let load $2$ slide on load $1$.

This integral gives the total kinetic energy of the system in motion. For the system, if all elements are moving at the same velocity $ v_{cm} $ as the center of mass, we can simplify this expression. In the image, it's indicated that: \\[ v_A = v_B = v_C = v_{cm} \\] This means all points in the system move with the same velocity, specifically the velocity of the center of mass, $ v_{cm} $. Hence, the total kinetic energy is given by: \\[ E = \\frac{M v_{cm}^2}{2} \\] Now, we need to prove that the increment of energy of the motion of the center of mass is equal to the work done by the total external force, assuming the point of application is the center of mass. Let $ {F}_{\\text{ext}} $ be the total external force acting on the system. 2.

Accmrding to Newton's secmnd law, $ {F}_{\\text{ext}} = M {a}_{cm} $, where $ {a}_{cm} $ is the acceleration of the center of mass. 4. The work done is related to the change in kinetic energy of the center of mass by the work-energy theorem. The kinetic energy of the center of mass is: \\[ E_{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{1}{2} M v_{cm}^2 \\] 5. The increment of this energy is: \\[ dE_{\\text{cm}} = M v_{cm} , dv_{cm} \\] 6.

      "Applying Energy Conservation Law: $$ m_1 g h = Q + m_2 g H\\tag{1} $$ where $Q$ is lost energy by heat and $H$ is the height achieved by body of mass $m_2$ after the impact of body of mass $m_1$, and is given by, $$ H = h + \\frac{v^2}{2g}\\tag{2} $$ Why? Potential energy of body 1 is converted in kinetic energy of body 1 and kinetic energy of body 2 with same velocity due to the constraint ($v_1=v_2=v$), after totally inelastic collision with ground, part of this energy is transformed in heat and the other one in potential energy for body 2, which behaves as a projectile launched vertically upwards from height $h$. For determining this velocity $v$, it's necessary to know what acceleration did the system have before impact. Applying Newton Second Law, for body 1: $$ m_1 g - T = m_1 a \\tag{3} $$ and for body 2, $$ T - m_2 g = m_2 a\\tag{4} $$ Suming up equations (3) and (4) side by side, $$ a = \\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}g\\tag{5} $$ As $h = \\frac{v^2}{2a}$, so, $$ v = \\sqrt{2ah}\\tag{6} $$ Substituting (5) into (6), $$ v = \\sqrt{2gh\\left(\\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}\\right)}\\tag{7} $$ Putting (7) into (2) $$ H = \\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}h\\tag{8} $$ Finally, substituting (8) into (1) and separating $Q$, $$ Q = m_1gh \\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2} $$\n",

This results in: \\[ a = 150 \\times 10^6 - 695,700 \\approx 149.3 \\times 10^6 ~ \\text{km}. \\] The resulting velocity requirement is \\( 2.8 ~ \\text{km/s} \\) at aphelion. Earth travels around the Sun at about \\( 29.8 ~ \\text{km/s} \\). So, we need to throw the object with at least \\( 27 ~ \\text{km/s} \\). Of course, we also need to escape Earth's gravity. The moment we throw something retrograde, Earth starts pulling it prograde, so the object gains kinetic energy again. To counteract this, we must throw the object with the extra kinetic energy required in excess of the gravitational potential energy. The escape velocity of Earth is \\( 11.2 ~ \\text{km/s} \\). Since kinetic energy grows with the square of the throwing velocity, we find the new throwing velocity \\( v_{\\text{throw}} \\): \\[ v_{\\text{throw}} = \\sqrt{11.2^2 + 27^2} = 29.2 ~\\text{km/s}. \\] Note: Earth's trajectory is not exactly circular, so try and throw it at aphelion if you're planning on doing this for real. A detailed discussion can be found at physics.stackexchange.com Answer: $v_{\\text{min}} = 29 ~\\text{km/s}$\n",

      "First, let's note that knowledge of the trajectory is not necessary to solve the problem. In general, it is a curvilinear segment that is part of a conic section (ellipse/parabola/hyperbola, depending on the initial velocity). Recall the derivation of the formula from 2.6.42* . Since the specific angular momentum at the starting point, $l=uR$ is the same for both the station and the probe, the changes in their velocities $\\Delta v$ are the same if the swept angle is $\\int d\\varphi = \\alpha$ for both satellites. Then it is easy to write down the law of conservation of angular momentum for the probe and get the answer. $$ d\\vec v=-\\frac{GM}{v_n r_n}d\\varphi\\cdot \\hat r. $$ The total change in velocity is summed up as follows: $$ \\Delta\\vec v = -\\frac{GM}{V_nr_n}\\int\\hat rd\\varphi, $$ that is, it is necessary to take into account the change in the direction of this radial increment at each point due to the rotation of the basis vector $\\hat r$. But this change $\\Delta\\vec v$ is exactly the same for both the probe and the station when in sum they sweep out the angle $\\alpha$. The most important thing is that this integration does not depend on the distance $r$ of the probe/station to the planet, but depends only on the angular position of the object. In other words, in Cartesian coordinates $\\hat r = \\hat x\\sin\\varphi + \\hat y\\cos\\varphi$, and such coordinates, being tied to the probe, do not rotate, which means that the integration goes into $$ \\int\\hat rd\\varphi = \\hat x\\int\\sin\\varphi d\\varphi +\\hat y\\int\\cos\\varphi d\\varphi. $$ The total velocity of the probe is made up of the vector sum of the velocities $\\vec u + \\vec V + \\int d\\vec v$. Without the additionally communicated speed $\\vec u + \\int d\\vec v$, the station would essentially move in a circle, and $$ \\frac{dv}{dt}=\\frac{u^2}{R} $$ Although $d\\vec v$ is directed to the center of the planet, due to the ship's motion along a certain trajectory, its total angular momentum generated is, generally speaking, not equal to zero. That is, when writing the law of conservation of angular momentum, it is necessary, firstly, to take into account the emerging angular momentum arm $r\\sin\\alpha$ for the velocity $\\vec V$ and, secondly, to take into account that the angular momentum component for the velocity $\\vec u + \\int d\\vec v$ is equal to $ur$ (because $\\vec u + \\int d\\vec v$ will always be perpendicular to the radius vector $\\vec r$). We understand that the integration is carried out from $0$ to $\\alpha$ simultaneously for both the probe and the station. This means that their vector increments $\\Delta\\vec v$ are indeed equal – then their difference remains $\\vec V$. The station, although it receives a vector increment $\\Delta\\vec v$ after some time, simply turns along its circular trajectory, maintaining its velocity $u$ in absolute value and remaining perpendicular to $\\hat r$. This again confirms previous idea that $\\vec u+∫d\\vec v$ will always be perpendicular to the radius vector $\\vec r$. Now, we can get $$ uR=ur-V\\cdot r\\sin\\alpha , $$ From where we express and obtain $$ \\boxed{r=\\frac{R}{1-\\frac{V}{u} \\sin\\alpha}} $$ The moment of velocity (vector product of velocity and radius vector drawn from the center of orbit) of the probe is the same as the moment of velocity of the station; if the probe and station rotate by the same angle, the velocity vectors will change equally. From the constancy of the moment of velocity of the probe: $up = (v − V \\sin\\alpha )r$ it follows that $r = p/(1 − \\varepsilon \\sin\\alpha )$, where $\\varepsilon = V /u$. For $\\varepsilon < 1$ the trajectory of the probe is an ellipse, for $\\varepsilon = 1$ it is a parabola, for $\\varepsilon > 1$ it is a hyperbola.\n",

      "$3.1.3.$ a. A body of mass $m$ suspended on a spring oscillates such that the greatest value of velocity is $v_0$, and the greatest deviation from the equilibrium position is $x_0$. Determine the stiffness of the spring. b. The velocity of a body of mass $m$ suspended on a spring and oscillating depends on the coordinate of the body $x$ according to the law $v = v_0 \\sqrt{ 1 - (\\frac{x}{x_0})^2}$. Find the relation between the force acting on the body and the potential energy of the body and the coordinate $x$. Does the result depend on the nature of the force that makes the body move according to the above law?\n",

      "SOLUTION (plain text):\n",
      "Since the oscillations are harmonic, the greatest velocity $v_0$ can be found through the greatest deviation from the equilibrium position $x_0$. To do this, we take the derivative of the solution to the equation of harmonic oscillations $$ v=\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(x_0\\sin\\omega t\\right)=x_0\\omega\\cos\\omega t $$ From which it follows that the maximum speed $v_0$ is equal to $$ v_0=x_0\\omega $$ Substituting the value for the cyclic frequency $\\omega$ of the spring pendulum $\\left(\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$ obtained earlier from 3.1.2 $$ v_0=x_0\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\Rightarrow\\boxed{k=\\frac{v_0^2m}{x_0^2}} $$ b) The restoring force in these harmonic oscillations will be the elastic force of the spring $F=-kx$, since in any case in a conventional spring pendulum the restoring force is equal to the elastic force of the spring. Then we find the work of this force as in 3.1.2 : $$ \\boxed{U=\\frac{kx^2}{2}} $$ a. $k=mv_0^2/x_0^2$ б. $F=-kx, ~U=kx^2/2, ~k=m(v_0/x_0)^2$ No, it doesn't depend.\n",

      "Harmonic motion of a light bulb using a mathematical pendulum as an example The power of the light bulb, and as a consequence the intensity of the light bulb, remains constant, so the longer the light bulb is at a certain moment, the more energy comes to the eye. Because the human eye perceives and accumulates light energy at a particularly high frequency of change (more details: doi.org/10.1016/S0042-6989(99)00084-X ), then the longer the body is at a certain point, the brighter it seems to the retina of our eye The perceived energy is inversely proportional to the time spent in a given place: $$ W\\sim\\Delta t $$ In harmonic motion, the position of the light bulb is described by the expression $$ x(t) = x_0 \\sin\\omega t $$ From here, the speed value changes as $$ v(t) = \\dot{x}(t) =\\omega\\cdot x_0\\cos\\omega t $$ The lower the speed, the more time it takes for the light bulb to cover equal intervals of time. $$ v\\sim\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} $$ Thus, when the speed of the light bulb during harmonic motion is minimal, the energy perceived by the eye becomes greater. $$ W\\sim \\frac{1}{v} $$ Thus, the bulb appears brighter in places where its speed is minimal, i.e. at its extreme points.\n",

      "The process will occur in two stages. At first, friction will prevent the piston from moving, and the gas will gradually heat up, and the pressure will increase isochronally. Then, as soon as we reach the threshold pressure, the piston will begin to move uniformly and the process will become isobaric. Let's consider the first process ($V = const$): $$ d(pV) = d(\\nu RT) $$ Let us integrate the equation from $p_0$ to the threshold pressure $p$: $$ \\int_{p_0}^{p} V d\\varphi = \\int_{T_0}^{T} \\nu R dT $$ $$ (p - p_0)V = \\nu R(T - T_0) $$ Since the process is isochoric, then $V = V_0 = \\frac{\\nu RT_0}{p_0}$. And considering that the piston is stationary, $p = p_0 + \\frac{F}{S}$. Substituting $V$ and $p$, we get: $$ \\frac{F}{S} \\cdot \\frac{T_0}{p_0} = T - T_0 $$ Let's write down the 1st law of thermodynamics, taking into account that $dA = 0$: $$ dQ = dU = c \\cdot dT \\rightarrow Q = c(T - T_0) $$ $$ T = T_0 + \\frac{Q}{c} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad Q \\leq \\frac{cT_0 F}{p_0 S} $$ Let's consider the second process ($p = const$): $$ d(pV) = d(\\nu RT) $$ $$ p dV = \\nu R dT $$ Now the piston has begun to move uniformly. According to the condition, half of the heat released by the piston friction against the cylinder walls goes into the gas. Let's find this heat: $$ Q_F = F \\cdot dx = F \\cdot \\frac{dV}{S} = \\frac{F \\nu R}{pS} dT $$ Let's write down the 1st law of thermodynamics: $$ dQ + \\frac{dQ_F}{2} = dA + dU $$ $$ \\int_0^Q dQ = \\int_{T_0}^{T} \\left( \\nu R + c - \\frac{F \\nu R}{2pS} \\right) dT $$ After integration, we get: $$ Q = \\left( \\nu R + c - \\frac{F \\nu R}{2pS} \\right) \\cdot (T - T_0) $$ From this expression, we find $T$: $$ T = \\frac{Q + cT_0 + RT_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{F}{2p_0 S} \\right)}{c \\left( 1 + \\frac{F}{p_0 S} \\right) + R \\left( 1 + \\frac{F}{2p_0 S} \\right)} \\cdot (1 + \\frac{F}{p_0 S}) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad Q \\geq \\frac{cT_0 F}{p_0 S} $$ $$ T=T_0+Q/c\\text{ with }Q\\leqslant Q_1=cT_0F/P_0S $$ $$ T=\\frac{Q+cT_0+RT_0(1+F/2P_0S)}{c(1+F/P_0S)+R(1+F/2P_0S)}\\left(1+\\frac F{P_0S}\\right)\\text{ with }Q\\geqslant Q_1 $$\n",

Applying Poisson Law for process $2-3$, $$ P_2V_1^\\gamma =P_3V_2^\\gamma $$ State equation for state 3 is $$ P_3V_2=nRT_3 $$ Separating $P_3$ and substituting into respective Poisson Law $$ T_3 = \\frac{P_2V_1^\\gamma}{nRV_2^{\\gamma -1}} \\tag{4} $$ Substituting $(3)$ and $(4)$ into $(2)$, and as $C_v=iR/2$ $$ Q_{34} = \\frac{i}{2}\\frac{V_1^\\gamma}{V_2^{\\gamma -1}}\\left(P_1-P_2\\right) \\tag{5} $$ For the process $1-2$ $$ Q_{12}=\\Delta U_{12} = nC_v\\left(T_2-T_1\\right) $$ Taking account the state equations for states 1 and 2, temperatures can be found, $$ Q_{12}=nC_v\\left(\\frac{P_2V_1}{nR}-\\frac{P_1V_1}{nR}\\right) $$ $$ Q_{12}=\\frac{i}{2}V_1\\left(P_2-P_1\\right) \\tag{6} $$ Putting $(5)$ and $(6)$ into $(1)$ $$ \\eta = 1-\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)^{\\gamma -1} $$ Since $\\gamma =C_p/C_v=1+2/i$ and $i=3$ (monoatomic gas), $$ \\boxed{\\eta = 1-\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}} $$ b) Let enumerate again the states following a clockwise way, this time starting in coordinate $(P_1,T_1)$. The efficience is $$ \\eta = 1-\\frac{|Q_c|}{Q_h} \\tag{I} $$ For identifying correctly the reservoirs, let's see the following graph corresponding to the cycle in a $P$ vs $V$ plot. $P$ vs $V$ plot The hot reservoir is defined as $$ Q_h = Q_{23} + Q_{34} \\tag{II} $$ and cold one $$ Q_c = Q_{12} + Q_{41} \\tag{III} $$ Process $2-3$ is isobaric, then $$ Q_{23}=nC_p\\left(T_2-T_1\\right) \\tag{IV} $$ Process $3-4$ is isothermal, so $$ Q_{34} = A_{34} = nRT_2\\ln{\\frac{V_4}{V_3}} $$ Since $V=nRT/P$ according state equation $$ Q_{34} = nRT_2\\ln{\\frac{P_2}{P_1}} \\tag{V} $$ Substituting $(IV)$ and $(V)$ into $(II)$and taking account that $C_p=(i+2)R/2$ $$ Q_h = \\frac{i+2}{2}nR\\left(T_2-T_1\\right)+nRT_2\\ln{\\frac{P_2}{P_1}} \\tag{VI} $$ Process $1-2$ is isothermal, so $$ Q_{12}=A_{12}=nRT_1\\ln{\\frac{V_2}{V_1}} $$ and newly, taking account state equation $$ Q_{12}=A_{12}=nRT_1\\ln{\\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\tag{VII}} $$ Finally, process $4-1$ is isobaric $$ Q_{14} = nC_p\\left(T_1-T_2\\right) \\tag{VIII} $$ Substituting $(VII)$ and $(VIII)$ into $(III)$ $$ Q_c = nRT_1\\ln{\\frac{P_1}{P_2}}+\\frac{i+2}{2}nR\\left(T_1-T_2\\right) \\tag{IX} $$ Substituting $(VI)$ and $(IX)$ into $(I)$ and developing algebraically $$ \\eta = \\frac{2\\left(T_2-T_1\\right)\\ln{\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}}{(i+2)\\left(T_2-T_1\\right)+2T_2\\ln{\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}} $$ Since gas is monoatomic, $i = 3$, hence $$ \\boxed{\\eta = \\frac{2\\left(T_2-T_1\\right)\\ln{\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}}{5\\left(T_2-T_1\\right)+2T_2\\ln{\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}}} $$\n",

Let's consider now a point inside of one of these infinite plates (for example, in the upper one).

      "Here, the idea for solving the problem is to use superposition's principle: considering a sphere of radius $R$ (bigger one) with bulk charge density $\\rho$ and smaller one with bulk charge density $-\\rho$, such that when superposition occurs, the cavity have no charge. Moreover, let's consider the following figure for organizing the solving process. Regions for analysis Above picture shows four regions to study. Let's begin with first one... Applying Gauss's Law for bigger sphere (without cavity) at distance $x$ from its center, $$ E_b(x)\\cdot 4\\pi x^2 = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho\\cdot 4\\pi x^3}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ $$ E_b(x) = \\frac{\\rho x}{3\\varepsilon_0} \\tag{1} $$ while for smaller one, $$ E_s(r')\\cdot 4\\pi r'^2 = \\frac{q_{enc}'}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho\\cdot 4\\pi r^3}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ $$ E_s(r') = \\frac{\\rho r^3}{3 r'^2 \\varepsilon_0} \\tag{2} $$ In this region $\\vec{E_b}\\uparrow\\uparrow \\vec{E_s}$, overlapping $$ E(x,r') = E_s(r') + E_b(x) \\tag{3} $$ Putting $(1)$ and $(2)$ into $(3)$, $$ E(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left(x+\\frac{r^3}{r'^2}\\right) $$ but $r' = l-x$, so Answer 1 $$ E_I(x) = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left[x+\\frac{r^3}{(l-x)^2}\\right] $$ for $0\\leq x\\leq l-r$. For region II, let's separate region in two subregions II$_1$ and II$_2$. For first subregion, field generated by bigger sphere (without cavity) is given by $(1)$. While for smaller one, $$ E_s(r')\\cdot 4\\pi r'^2 = \\frac{q_{enc}'}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho\\cdot 4\\pi r'^3}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ $$ E_s(r') = \\frac{\\rho r'}{3\\varepsilon_0} \\tag{4} $$ In this subregion, $\\vec{E_s}\\uparrow\\uparrow \\vec{E_b}$, so overlapping $$ E_{II_1}(x,r') = E_s(r') + E_b(x) \\tag{5} $$ Substituting (1) and (4) into (5), $$ E_{II_1}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}(x+r') $$ but $l=x+r'$, hence $$ E_{II_1} = \\frac{\\rho l}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ For second subregion, field generated by bigger sphere (without cavity) still given by $(1)$ and the generated one by smaller sphere is given by $(4)$, but $\\vec{E_s}\\uparrow\\downarrow\\vec{E_b}$, so overlapping $$ E_{II_2}(x,r') = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \\tag{6} $$ Putting $(1)$ and $(4)$ into $(6)$ $$ E_{II_2}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}(x-r') $$ but in this case $l = x-r'$, $$ E_{II_2} = \\frac{\\rho l}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ Finally, $E_{II_1} = E_{II_2} = E_{II}$ Answer 2 $$ E_{II} = \\frac{\\rho l}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ for $l-r\\leq x \\leq l+r$ For region III, smaller-sphere's field is given by $(2)$, while bigger-sphere's field is given by $(1)$, as $\\vec{E_s}\\uparrow\\downarrow\\vec{E_b}$, overlapping $$ E_{III}(r',x) = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \\tag{7} $$ Putting $(1)$ and $(2)$ into $(7)$ $$ E_{III}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left(x - \\frac{r^3}{r'^2}\\right) $$ as $r' = x-l$, Answer 3 $$ E_{III}(x) = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left[x-\\frac{r^3}{(x-l)^2}\\right] $$ for $l+r \\leq x \\leq R$. For region IV (points outside bigger sphere), applying Gauss's Law for bigger sphere, $$ E_b(x) \\cdot 4\\pi x^2 = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho\\cdot 4\\pi R^3}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ $$ E_b(x) = \\frac{\\rho R^3}{3\\varepsilon_0 x^2} \\tag{8} $$ while for smaller one, field is given by (4). Since $\\vec{E_s}\\uparrow\\downarrow\\vec{E_b}$, overlapping $$ E_{IV}(x,r') = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \\tag{9} $$ Putting $(4)$ and $(8)$ into $(9)$ $$ E_{IV}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left(\\frac{R^3}{x^2}-\\frac{r^3}{r'^2}\\right) $$ but $l = x-r'$, Answer 4 $$ E_{IV}(x) = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left[\\frac{R^3}{x^2}-\\frac{r^3}{(x-l)^2}\\right] $$ for $x > R$. For proofing the homogenity of field inside cavity, let's consider any point P inside cavity. Absolute value of bigger-sphere's field is given by $(1)$ and directed over $\\hat{x}$ direction, while absolute value of smaller-sphere's field is given by $(4)$ and directed over $-\\hat{r'}$ direction. Overlapping $$ \\vec{E}(x,r') = \\vec{E_b}(x) + \\vec{E_s}(r') = E_b(x) \\hat{x} - E_s(r') \\hat{r'} \\tag{10} $$ Substituting $(1)$ and $(4)$ into $(10)$ $$ \\vec{E}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}(x\\hat{x}-r'\\hat{r'}) $$ $$ \\vec{E}(\\vec{x},\\vec{r'}) = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}(\\vec{x}-\\vec{r'}) $$ but $\\vec{l} = \\vec{x} -\\vec{r'}$, hence $$ \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho\\vec{l}}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ Answer 5 Since $E$ is constant, it is homogeneous inside cavity.\n",

      "1. Hitting the first surface Let's imagine there is a parallel lays of light entering the lens with refractive index $n_1$ from media with refractive index $n_0$, and after lens there is a media with refractive index $n_2$. First, let's consider the moment when ray hits front of lens at the point $h$ above optical axis. As shown in the picture, the incidence angle is $$ \\tan(\\alpha) \\approx \\frac{h}{R_1} \\approx sin{(\\alpha)} \\approx \\alpha $$ where $R_1$ is the curvature radius of first surface. If there wasn't second surface, the ray after refraction will cross the optical axis at point $x_1$, and angle is $\\tan(b) \\approx \\sin(\\beta) \\approx \\beta = x_1/h$. So, the refraction angle is $$ \\alpha - \\beta = \\frac{h}{R_1} - \\frac{h}{x_1} $$ And by Snell's law: $$ n_0 \\cdot \\frac{h}{R_1} = n_1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{h}{R_1} - \\frac{h}{R_2}\\right) $$ 2. Hitting the second surface After hitting the second surface, the ray will cross the axis at point $x_2$, which we want to find. The incidence angle is $$ \\alpha_2 = \\frac{h}{R_2} + \\frac{h}{x_1} $$ And the refraction angle is $$ \\beta_2 = \\frac{h}{R_2} + \\frac{h}{x_2} $$ By Snell's Law: $$ n_1 \\cdot \\alpha_2 = n_2 \\cdot \\beta_2 $$ Therefore: $$ n_1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{h}{R_2} + \\frac{h}{x_1} \\right) = n_2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{h}{R_2} + \\frac{h}{x_2} \\right) $$ So, we have a system of equations: $$\\begin{cases} n_0 \\cdot \\frac{h}{R_1} = n_1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{h}{R_1} - \\frac{h}{R_2}\\right)\\ n_1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{h}{R_2} + \\frac{h}{x_1} \\right) = n_2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{h}{R_2} + \\frac{h}{x_2} \\right) \\end{cases} $$ Solving it, we can find $\\frac{1}{x_2}$: $$ \\frac{1}{x_2} = \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} -1 \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} - \\frac{n_0}{n_2}  \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{R_1} = \\frac{1}{F} $$ In this problem, we have $n_0 = n_2 = 1, n_1 = n$ So, we have $$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{F} = \\left(n-1 \\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)} $$ $$ \\frac{1}{F}=(n-1)\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) $$\n",

      "Brightness is the specific luminance — the energy emitted in a given direction per unit area of a surface. When forming an image, whether by a lens or a mirror, the brightness does not increase — it remains the same as that of the source (neglecting losses). That is, the brightness of the Sun's image cannot exceed the brightness of the Sun’s surface. In general, if it were possible to get a brighter image, it would violate the law of conservation of energy. Now let's find the maximum illuminance of the Sun's image. Let \\( \\theta \\) be the angular size of the Sun as seen from Earth: \\[ \\theta = \\frac{D_C}{R_{orb}} \\] where: \\( D_C \\) is the diameter of the Sun (\\( 1.4 \\cdot 10^9 ~ \\text{m} \\)), \\( R_{orb} \\) is the radius of Earth's orbit (\\( 150 \\cdot 10^9 ~ \\text{m} \\)). Numerically, the Sun’s angular size is: \\[ \\theta \\approx 0.0093 ~ \\text{rad} \\] This is a small angle, so we can approximate \\( \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\) and \\( \\tan\\theta \\approx \\theta \\). The incident solar power through the mirror's surface: \\[ \\Phi = q \\cdot S = q \\cdot \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\tag{1} \\] where \\( q \\) is the energy flux density (solar irradiance).

The area of the Sun's image: \\[ S_c = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{R\\theta}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi R^2 \\theta^2}{16} \\tag{2} \\] Illuminance at the focus is defined as: \\[ E = \\frac{\\Phi}{S_c} \\tag{3} \\] Substituting (1) and (2) into (3): \\[ E = \\frac{q \\cdot \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}}{\\frac{\\pi R^2 \\theta^2}{16}} = \\frac{4q D^2}{R^2 \\theta^2} \\tag{4} \\] Solar energy flux density \\( q \\) on Earth can be expressed in terms of brightness \\( B \\) (by the definition of brightness): \\[ q = B \\cdot \\Omega \\] where \\( \\Omega \\) is the solid angle subtended by the Sun as seen from Earth. Let’s express the solid angle in terms of the angular size: \\[ \\Omega = \\frac{\\pi (R_{orb} \\cdot \\frac{\\theta}{2})^2}{R_{orb}^2} = \\frac{\\pi \\theta^2}{4} \\tag{5} \\] So, \\[ q = B \\cdot \\frac{\\pi \\theta^2}{4} \\tag{6} \\] Substitute (6) into (4): \\[ E = \\frac{4 D^2}{R^2 \\theta^2} \\cdot B \\cdot \\frac{\\pi \\theta^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{R^2} B \\] No , it is not possible to obtain an image of the Sun with brightness greater than that of the Sun itself. \\[ E_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{R^2} B \\]\n",

      "$13.4.21.$ A beetle is photographed at two different scales by placing the camera at distances equal to three and five times the focal length of the lens, respectively.

      "SOLUTION (plain text):\n",
      "Since the aperture diameter is much smaller than the distance to the beetle, the beetle can be considered a point source, with light reaching the lens in nearly parallel rays. The larger the area of the aperture, the more light will reach the film from the beetle, and thus the greater the illumination of the film. That is, \\(E \\sim d^2\\), where \\(d\\) is the aperture diameter. On the other hand, the illumination decreases with the square of the distance from the lens to the image. For a point source emitting flux \\(\\Phi\\), in an isotropic, homogeneous medium, the illumination on a sphere of radius \\(b\\) is: $$E = \\frac{\\Phi}{S} = \\frac{\\Phi}{4\\pi b^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{b^2}$$ In this problem, \\(b\\) is the distance from the lens to the image. Thus, the illumination of the film is directly proportional to the square of the aperture diameter and inversely proportional to the square of the image distance: $$E \\sim \\left( \\frac{d}{b} \\right)^2$$ According to the problem, the illumination is the same in both shooting conditions: $$E_1 = E_2$$ $$\\left( \\frac{d_1}{b_1} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{d_2}{b_2} \\right)^2$$ Solving for \\(d_2\\): $$d_2 = \\frac{b_2}{b_1} d_1 \\tag{1}$$ To find \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\), we use the lens equation: $$\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{f} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{a}$$ For \\(a = a_1 = 3f\\): $$\\frac{1}{b_1} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{3f} = \\frac{2}{3f} \\Rightarrow b_1 = \\frac{3f}{2}$$ For \\(a = a_2 = 5f\\): $$\\frac{1}{b_2} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{5f} = \\frac{4}{5f} \\Rightarrow b_2 = \\frac{5f}{4}$$ Substitute these into equation (1): $$d_2 = \\frac{\\frac{5f}{4}}{\\frac{3f}{2}} d_1 = \\frac{5}{6} d_1$$ \\(d_2 = \\frac{5}{6} d_1\\)\n",

      "Linear magnification \\(k\\) is the ratio of the image size to the object size. For a thin lens, linear magnification can be expressed as the ratio of the image distance \\(b\\) (from the lens to the image) to the object distance \\(a\\) (from the object to the lens): $$k = \\frac{b}{a} \\tag{1}$$ The lens equation is: $$\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{f} \\tag{2}$$ where \\(f\\) is the focal length of the lens. From equation (1), we find \\(a = \\frac{b}{k}\\). Substituting this into equation (2): $$\\frac{k}{b} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{f} \\Rightarrow \\frac{k + 1}{b} = \\frac{1}{f} \\Rightarrow b = f(k + 1)$$ The illumination on the film is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the lens to the film (according to the inverse square law): $$E \\sim \\frac{1}{b^2} = \\frac{1}{f^2(k + 1)^2}$$ If the focal length \\(f\\) is fixed, then illumination is inversely proportional to \\((k + 1)^2\\): $$E \\sim \\frac{1}{(k + 1)^2}$$ To maintain the same exposure when illumination decreases, the exposure time must be increased proportionally: $$t \\sim (k + 1)^2$$ So, for two magnifications: $$\\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \\frac{(k_1 + 1)^2}{(k_2 + 1)^2}$$ Hence: $$t_1 = t_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1 + 1}{k_2 + 1} \\right)^2$$ $$ t_1 = t_2 \\left( \\dfrac{k_1 + 1}{k_2 + 1} \\right)^2 $$\n",

      "We’ll model the interaction of light with fog particles. We'll assume that the light intensity decreases due to absorption by the droplets. We'll neglect scattering effects, which is acceptable if the droplet size is larger than the wavelength of light. We treat the fog droplets as ideal spheres with cross-sectional area \\(S = \\pi r^2\\). When a photon encounters a droplet, we assume it is absorbed and its energy is converted entirely into internal energy (heat). A droplet can absorb any number of photons. Now consider a thin volume element between two parallel planes separated by a small thickness \\(dx\\). Light travels perpendicular to these planes. Suppose there are \\(N\\) droplets in volume \\(V\\). If a photon enters a sub-volume \\(V_k = \\pi r^2 dx\\) that contains a droplet, it will be absorbed. The probability \\(p\\) that a photon will be absorbed is: $$p = \\frac{N \\pi r^2 dx}{V} \\tag{1}$$ On the other hand, if the incoming light intensity is \\(I\\), and the outgoing is \\(I - dI\\), the change \\(-dI\\) reflects the absorbed photons. So the absorption probability is also: $$p = \\frac{-dI}{I} \\tag{2}$$ Equating (1) and (2): $$-\\frac{dI}{I} = \\frac{N \\pi r^2 dx}{V}$$ Integrate this differential equation from \\(I_0\\) to \\(0.9 I_0\\) (since intensity drops by 10%) and from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = L\\): $$\\int_{I_0}^{0.9 I_0} \\frac{dI}{I} = -\\frac{N \\pi r^2}{V} \\int_0^L dx$$ $$\\ln \\frac{0.9 I_0}{I_0} = -\\frac{N \\pi r^2}{V} L$$ $$\\ln 0.9 = -\\frac{N}{V} \\pi r^2 L$$ Let \\(n = \\frac{N}{V}\\), the number of droplets per unit volume: $$n = \\frac{-\\ln 0.9}{\\pi r^2 L}$$ Using the approximation: $$-\\ln 0.9 \\approx 0.1 = \\frac{1}{10}$$ We get the final estimate: $$n \\approx \\frac{1}{10 \\pi r^2 L} = \\left(10 \\pi r^2 L\\right)^{-1}$$ \\(n \\approx (10 \\pi r^2 L)^{-1}\\)\n",

Since the energy of a photon is related to its frequency by \\( E = h\\nu \\), a loss of energy leads to a decrease in frequency and an increase in wavelength. The frequency shift goes toward lower values. In the optical range, this means a shift of the emission spectrum toward the red region (wavelengths increase).

      " The idea for solving this problem is to consider superposition principle: as cavity is uncharged, we can suppose that it exists a superposition of a plate (with charge density $\\rho$) and a sphere with charge density $-\\rho$. So, if we analyze the field in $A$ without cavity, we have two plates of thickness $\\frac{h}{2}$, one over $A$ and the other one under A, both with charge density $\\rho$, then field in $A$ is null. While for $A$ in the sphere's surface, applying Gauss's Law, $$ -E_A\\cdot 4\\pi\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{q_{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0} $$ as $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^3$, so $6\\frac{V}{h} = 4\\pi\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2$, and taking in account that $\\rho = \\frac{q_{enc}}{V}$ Answer 1 $$ E_A = \\frac{\\rho h}{6\\varepsilon_0} $$ For point $B$, the way is similar: in this case the plate without cavity generates certain field in $B$, located on its surface.

      " Here, the idea for solving the problem is to use superposition's principle: considering a sphere of radius $R$ (bigger one) with bulk charge density $\\rho$ and smaller one with bulk charge density $-\\rho$, such that when superposition occurs, the cavity have no charge. Moreover, let's consider the following figure for organizing the solving process. Regions for analysis Above picture shows four regions to study. Let's begin with first one... Applying Gauss's Law for bigger sphere (without cavity) at distance $x$ from its center, $$ E_b(x)\\cdot 4\\pi x^2 = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho\\cdot 4\\pi x^3}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ $$ E_b(x) = \\frac{\\rho x}{3\\varepsilon_0} \\tag{1} $$ while for smaller one, $$ E_s(r')\\cdot 4\\pi r'^2 = \\frac{q_{enc}'}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho\\cdot 4\\pi r^3}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ $$ E_s(r') = \\frac{\\rho r^3}{3 r'^2 \\varepsilon_0} \\tag{2} $$ In this region $\\vec{E_b}\\uparrow\\uparrow \\vec{E_s}$, overlapping $$ E(x,r') = E_s(r') + E_b(x) \\tag{3} $$ Putting $(1)$ and $(2)$ into $(3)$, $$ E(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left(x+\\frac{r^3}{r'^2}\\right) $$ but $r' = l-x$, so Answer 1 $$ E_I(x) = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left[x+\\frac{r^3}{(l-x)^2}\\right] $$ for $0\\leq x\\leq l-r$. For region II, let's separate region in two subregions II$_1$ and II$_2$. For first subregion, field generated by bigger sphere (without cavity) is given by $(1)$. While for smaller one, $$ E_s(r')\\cdot 4\\pi r'^2 = \\frac{q_{enc}'}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho\\cdot 4\\pi r'^3}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ $$ E_s(r') = \\frac{\\rho r'}{3\\varepsilon_0} \\tag{4} $$ In this subregion, $\\vec{E_s}\\uparrow\\uparrow \\vec{E_b}$, so overlapping $$ E_{II_1}(x,r') = E_s(r') + E_b(x) \\tag{5} $$ Substituting (1) and (4) into (5), $$ E_{II_1}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}(x+r') $$ but $l=x+r'$, hence $$ E_{II_1} = \\frac{\\rho l}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ For second subregion, field generated by bigger sphere (without cavity) still given by $(1)$ and the generated one by smaller sphere is given by $(4)$, but $\\vec{E_s}\\uparrow\\downarrow\\vec{E_b}$, so overlapping $$ E_{II_2}(x,r') = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \\tag{6} $$ Putting $(1)$ and $(4)$ into $(6)$ $$ E_{II_2}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}(x-r') $$ but in this case $l = x-r'$, $$ E_{II_2} = \\frac{\\rho l}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ Finally, $E_{II_1} = E_{II_2} = E_{II}$ Answer 2 $$ E_{II} = \\frac{\\rho l}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ for $l-r\\leq x \\leq l+r$ For region III, smaller-sphere's field is given by $(2)$, while bigger-sphere's field is given by $(1)$, as $\\vec{E_s}\\uparrow\\downarrow\\vec{E_b}$, overlapping $$ E_{III}(r',x) = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \\tag{7} $$ Putting $(1)$ and $(2)$ into $(7)$ $$ E_{III}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left(x - \\frac{r^3}{r'^2}\\right) $$ as $r' = x-l$, Answer 3 $$ E_{III}(x) = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left[x-\\frac{r^3}{(x-l)^2}\\right] $$ for $l+r \\leq x \\leq R$. For region IV (points outside bigger sphere), applying Gauss's Law for bigger sphere, $$ E_b(x) \\cdot 4\\pi x^2 = \\frac{q_{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho\\cdot 4\\pi R^3}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ $$ E_b(x) = \\frac{\\rho R^3}{3\\varepsilon_0 x^2} \\tag{8} $$ while for smaller one, field is given by (4). Since $\\vec{E_s}\\uparrow\\downarrow\\vec{E_b}$, overlapping $$ E_{IV}(x,r') = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \\tag{9} $$ Putting $(4)$ and $(8)$ into $(9)$ $$ E_{IV}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left(\\frac{R^3}{x^2}-\\frac{r^3}{r'^2}\\right) $$ but $l = x-r'$, Answer 4 $$ E_{IV}(x) = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\left[\\frac{R^3}{x^2}-\\frac{r^3}{(x-l)^2}\\right] $$ for $x > R$. For proofing the homogenity of field inside cavity, let's consider any point P inside cavity. Absolute value of bigger-sphere's field is given by $(1)$ and directed over $\\hat{x}$ direction, while absolute value of smaller-sphere's field is given by $(4)$ and directed over $-\\hat{r'}$ direction. Overlapping $$ \\vec{E}(x,r') = \\vec{E_b}(x) + \\vec{E_s}(r') = E_b(x) \\hat{x} - E_s(r') \\hat{r'} \\tag{10} $$ Substituting $(1)$ and $(4)$ into $(10)$ $$ \\vec{E}(x,r') = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}(x\\hat{x}-r'\\hat{r'}) $$ $$ \\vec{E}(\\vec{x},\\vec{r'}) = \\frac{\\rho}{3\\varepsilon_0}(\\vec{x}-\\vec{r'}) $$ but $\\vec{l} = \\vec{x} -\\vec{r'}$, hence $$ \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho\\vec{l}}{3\\varepsilon_0} $$ Answer 5 Since $E$ is constant, it is homogeneous inside cavity.\n",

      " Without magnetic field, electrical force is equivalent to centripetal force: $$ m_e\\frac{{v_0}^2}{R} = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R^2} $$ and cosnidering that $\\omega_0 = v_0 R$, $$ {\\omega_0}^2 = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 m_e R^3} \\tag{1} $$ If magnetic force is bigger than electric one, electron abandons the system, so $$ \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R^2}-evB = m_e\\frac{v^2}{R} $$ where $v = \\omega R$, then $$ \\omega^2 = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 m_e R^3} - \\frac{e\\omega B}{m_e} $$ Taking in account (1), $$ \\omega^2 + \\frac{e\\omega B}{m_e} - {\\omega_0}^2 = 0 $$ Applying the general formula of solution for quadratic equations, and considering $\\omega > 0$ $$ \\omega = -\\frac{eB}{2m_e} + \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2B^2}{4{m_e}^2}+{\\omega_0}^2} $$ Now, it's time to check the orders of each magnitude. Let's see the terms under square root. Let's consider $e \\approx 10^{-19} {\\rm{C}}$, $B \\approx 10^{-6} T$ (due to problem refers to weak magnetic field, we take in account the order of Earth's magnetic field from Problem 10.1.2), $m_e \\approx 10^{-31} {\\rm{kg}}$ and $R \\approx 10^{-10} {\\rm{m}}$ (in the order of Å).

Hitting the first surface Let's imagine there is a parallel lays of light entering the lens with refractive index $n_1$ from media with refractive index $n_0$, and after lens there is a media with refractive index $n_2$. First, let's consider the moment when ray hits front of lens at the point $h$ above optical axis. As shown in the picture, the incidence angle is $$ \\tan(\\alpha) \\approx \\frac{h}{R_1} \\approx sin{(\\alpha)} \\approx \\alpha $$ where $R_1$ is the curvature radius of first surface. If there wasn't second surface, the ray after refraction will cross the optical axis at point $x_1$, and angle is $\\tan(b) \\approx \\sin(\\beta) \\approx \\beta = x_1/h$.

      " Brightness is the specific luminance — the energy emitted in a given direction per unit area of a surface. When forming an image, whether by a lens or a mirror, the brightness does not increase — it remains the same as that of the source (neglecting losses). That is, the brightness of the Sun's image cannot exceed the brightness of the Sun’s surface. In general, if it were possible to get a brighter image, it would violate the law of conservation of energy. Now let's find the maximum illuminance of the Sun's image. Let \\( \\theta \\) be the angular size of the Sun as seen from Earth: \\[ \\theta = \\frac{D_C}{R_{orb}} \\] where: \\( D_C \\) is the diameter of the Sun (\\( 1.4 \\cdot 10^9 ~ \\text{m} \\)), \\( R_{orb} \\) is the radius of Earth's orbit (\\( 150 \\cdot 10^9 ~ \\text{m} \\)). Numerically, the Sun’s angular size is: \\[ \\theta \\approx 0.0093 ~ \\text{rad} \\] This is a small angle, so we can approximate \\( \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\) and \\( \\tan\\theta \\approx \\theta \\). The incident solar power through the mirror's surface: \\[ \\Phi = q \\cdot S = q \\cdot \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\tag{1} \\] where \\( q \\) is the energy flux density (solar irradiance).

The area of the Sun's image: \\[ S_c = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{R\\theta}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi R^2 \\theta^2}{16} \\tag{2} \\] Illuminance at the focus is defined as: \\[ E = \\frac{\\Phi}{S_c} \\tag{3} \\] Substituting (1) and (2) into (3): \\[ E = \\frac{q \\cdot \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}}{\\frac{\\pi R^2 \\theta^2}{16}} = \\frac{4q D^2}{R^2 \\theta^2} \\tag{4} \\] Solar energy flux density \\( q \\) on Earth can be expressed in terms of brightness \\( B \\) (by the definition of brightness): \\[ q = B \\cdot \\Omega \\] where \\( \\Omega \\) is the solid angle subtended by the Sun as seen from Earth.

      "\n",
      "**1. Light Gathering Power:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** During the day, the sky is filled with scattered sunlight. This scattered sunlight is much brighter than the faint light from stars. The human eye is not sensitive enough to distinguish the faint starlight from the bright daylight.\n",
      "*   **The Telescope's Solution:** Telescopes have a much larger light-gathering area (the objective lens or mirror) than the human eye. This means they can collect significantly more light from the stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Contrast Enhancement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** The contrast between the starlight and the background sky is very low during the day. The bright daylight washes out the faint starlight.\n",
      "*   **The Telescope's Solution:** By focusing the starlight onto a smaller area (the focal point), the telescope concentrates the starlight. While the scattered sunlight is also focused, the relative increase in starlight intensity is much greater. This improves the contrast, making the stars more visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Minimizing Scattered Light (Indirectly):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** Scattered sunlight is the primary reason stars are not visible to the naked eye during the day.\n",
      "*   **The Telescope's Solution:** While a telescope doesn't directly eliminate scattered sunlight, it helps to minimize its effect. By using a higher magnification, the telescope spreads out the scattered sunlight over a larger area in the eyepiece. This reduces the surface brightness of the scattered sunlight, making the starlight more apparent. Also, the telescope's tube blocks much of the ambient light from entering the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Atmospheric Conditions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** Atmospheric conditions (e.g., haze, clouds, air pollution) can scatter sunlight and reduce the visibility of stars, even through a telescope.\n",
      "*   **The Telescope's Solution:** Telescopes are not a perfect solution to atmospheric conditions, but they can help. A telescope will still gather more light from the stars than the human eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:** A telescope allows us to see bright stars during the day because it has a larger light-gathering area, which concentrates the starlight and improves the contrast between the star and the background sky.\n",

      " Since the aperture diameter is much smaller than the distance to the beetle, the beetle can be considered a point source, with light reaching the lens in nearly parallel rays. The larger the area of the aperture, the more light will reach the film from the beetle, and thus the greater the illumination of the film. That is, \\(E \\sim d^2\\), where \\(d\\) is the aperture diameter. On the other hand, the illumination decreases with the square of the distance from the lens to the image. For a point source emitting flux \\(\\Phi\\), in an isotropic, homogeneous medium, the illumination on a sphere of radius \\(b\\) is: $$E = \\frac{\\Phi}{S} = \\frac{\\Phi}{4\\pi b^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{b^2}$$ In this problem, \\(b\\) is the distance from the lens to the image. Thus, the illumination of the film is directly proportional to the square of the aperture diameter and inversely proportional to the square of the image distance: $$E \\sim \\left( \\frac{d}{b} \\right)^2$$ According to the problem, the illumination is the same in both shooting conditions: $$E_1 = E_2$$ $$\\left( \\frac{d_1}{b_1} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{d_2}{b_2} \\right)^2$$ Solving for \\(d_2\\): $$d_2 = \\frac{b_2}{b_1} d_1 \\tag{1}$$ To find \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\), we use the lens equation: $$\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{f} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{a}$$ For \\(a = a_1 = 3f\\): $$\\frac{1}{b_1} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{3f} = \\frac{2}{3f} \\Rightarrow b_1 = \\frac{3f}{2}$$ For \\(a = a_2 = 5f\\): $$\\frac{1}{b_2} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{5f} = \\frac{4}{5f} \\Rightarrow b_2 = \\frac{5f}{4}$$ Substitute these into equation (1): $$d_2 = \\frac{\\frac{5f}{4}}{\\frac{3f}{2}} d_1 = \\frac{5}{6} d_1$$ \\(d_2 = \\frac{5}{6} d_1\\)\n",

We'll neglect scattering effects, which is acceptable if the droplet size is larger than the wavelength of light. We treat the fog droplets as ideal spheres with cross-sectional area \\(S = \\pi r^2\\). When a photon encounters a droplet, we assume it is absorbed and its energy is converted entirely into internal energy (heat). A droplet can absorb any number of photons. Now consider a thin volume element between two parallel planes separated by a small thickness \\(dx\\). Light travels perpendicular to these planes. Suppose there are \\(N\\) droplets in volume \\(V\\). If a photon enters a sub-volume \\(V_k = \\pi r^2 dx\\) that contains a droplet, it will be absorbed. The probability \\(p\\) that a photon will be absorbed is: $$p = \\frac{N \\pi r^2 dx}{V} \\tag{1}$$ On the other hand, if the incoming light intensity is \\(I\\), and the outgoing is \\(I - dI\\), the change \\(-dI\\) reflects the absorbed photons.

      "OFFICIAL ANSWER:\n",
      " According to General Relativity, the gravitational field near massive objects curves spacetime and affects the behavior of photons. When light is emitted from the surface of a star, it loses energy while overcoming the gravitational pull. Since the energy of a photon is related to its frequency by \\( E = h\\nu \\), a loss of energy leads to a decrease in frequency and an increase in wavelength. The frequency shift goes toward lower values. In the optical range, this means a shift of the emission spectrum toward the red region (wavelengths increase). That is why the effect is called redshift . Due to the gravitational attraction of photons to the star.\n",
      "\n",
      "GEMINI ANSWER:\n",
      " Here's a breakdown of the phenomenon described, along with an explanation and the reason for the name \"redshift\":\n",
      "\n",
      "**Understanding the Phenomenon: Gravitational Redshift**\n",
      "\n",
      "This effect is called gravitational redshift. It's a consequence of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Here's the core idea:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Energy and Gravity:** Light, even though it has no mass, is affected by gravity.  Gravity is essentially the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Light's Energy and Frequency:** The energy of a photon of light is directly proportional to its frequency (E = hf, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Climbing Out of a Gravity Well:** When light escapes from a massive object (like a star), it has to \"work\" against the gravitational pull.  Think of it like a ball rolling uphill.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Energy Loss and Frequency Shift:** As the light \"climbs out\" of the star's gravitational field, it loses energy.  Since energy is directly proportional to frequency, the light's frequency decreases.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Mass and Radius Dependence:**\n",
      "    *   **More Massive Star:** A more massive star has a stronger gravitational field.  The light has to expend more energy to escape, resulting in a greater decrease in frequency.\n",
      "    *   **Smaller Radius:** A smaller radius means the light is originating from a region of stronger gravitational field (for a given mass).  The light loses more energy as it travels a shorter distance to escape the star's gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why \"Redshift\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Electromagnetic Spectrum:** The visible spectrum of light ranges from violet (high frequency, high energy) to red (low frequency, low energy).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Frequency Decrease:** Since the light's frequency decreases due to gravitational redshift, the light shifts towards the red end of the spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Analogy to Doppler Effect:** The term \"redshift\" is borrowed from the Doppler effect, where the wavelength of light from a receding object is stretched, shifting it towards the red end of the spectrum. Although the underlying cause is different (gravity vs. motion), the observed effect on the light's color is similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Light loses energy as it escapes the gravitational field of a massive object.\n",
      "2.  This energy loss causes a decrease in the light's frequency.\n",
      "3.  The decrease in frequency shifts the light towards the red end of the spectrum (redshift).\n",
      "4.  The effect is more pronounced for more massive stars and stars with smaller radii.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Answer:**\n",
      "The effect is explained by the fact that light loses energy as it escapes a strong gravitational field. This energy loss causes a decrease in the light's frequency. Since the frequency decreases, the light shifts towards the red end of the spectrum, hence the name \"redshift\". The change in frequency is greater for more massive stars and stars with smaller radii because the gravitational field is stronger.\n",
